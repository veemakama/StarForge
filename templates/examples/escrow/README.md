# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

A token escrow smart contract for Soroban.

A buyer locks tokens in the contract; a neutral arbiter then either releases the
funds to the seller (on successful delivery) or refunds the buyer (on a
dispute). This is a common building block for marketplaces, freelance payments
and over-the-counter trades.

## Roles

- **Buyer** — funds the escrow and can release the funds to the seller.
- **Seller** — receives the funds on release and can refund the buyer.
- **Arbiter** — neutral third party who can release or refund to resolve a dispute.

## Features

- Initialize an escrow with buyer, seller, arbiter, token and amount
- Fund the escrow from the buyer
- Release funds to the seller (buyer or arbiter)
- Refund funds to the buyer (seller or arbiter)
- Inspect funded / settled state

## Build

```bash
stellar contract build

## Deploy
