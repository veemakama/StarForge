# Plugin Trust Model and Lifecycle

StarForge supports third-party plugins through a shared-library extension
system. This document describes the trust model, compatibility requirements,
and the full plugin lifecycle.

---

## Trust levels

Every installed plugin is assigned one of three trust levels at install time:

| Level | When assigned | StarForge behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Plugin installed via `--path` (no source URL) | Always loaded without warnings |
| `trusted` | Source URL matches a known trusted prefix | Loaded without warnings |
| `unknown` | Source URL provided but not in the allow-list | Warning shown on load; `--force` required to install |

### Trusted source prefixes

The following URL prefixes are automatically classified as `trusted`:

- `https://github.com/Nanle-code/starforge-*`
- `https://github.com/StarForge-Labs/*`
- `https://crates.io/crates/starforge-plugin-*`

Any other source is `unknown`.

---

## Compatibility requirements

Plugins are native shared libraries loaded at runtime via `libloading`.
Two compatibility checks run before a plugin is executed:

1. **rustc ABI check** — the plugin must be compiled with the same Rust
   toolchain version as StarForge.  Mismatches cause undefined behaviour
   and are rejected immediately.

2. **Core version check** — the plugin's declared `core_version` major
   number must match the running StarForge major version.  A plugin built
   for StarForge `0.x.y` is incompatible with StarForge `1.x.y`.

Both checks produce actionable error messages that tell you exactly what
to rebuild.

## Plugin lifecycle

### Install

```bash
# From a local path (always trusted)
starforge plugin install my-plugin --path ./libstarforge_my_plugin.so

# From a trusted source URL
starforge plugin install my-plugin --source https://github.com/Nanle-code/starforge-my-plugin

# From an unknown source (requires --force)
starforge plugin install my-plugin \
    --path ./libstarforge_my_plugin.so \
    --source https://example.com/my-plugin \
    --force
```

### List

```bash
starforge plugin list
```

Shows all installed plugins with their path, trust level, and source.

### Load and execute

```bash
starforge plugin load          # loads and reports all installed plugins
starforge my-plugin <args>     # execute a loaded plugin as an external subcommand
```

### Verify

```bash
starforge plugin verify              # verify all installed plugins
starforge plugin verify my-plugin    # verify a specific plugin
```

Checks:
- Library file exists on disk at the registered path
- Trust level is `local` or `trusted`

### Uninstall

```bash
starforge plugin uninstall my-plugin
```

Removes the plugin from the registry. The library file on disk is **not**
deleted — remove it manually if desired.

---

## Building a plugin

Use the `starforge-plugin-sdk` crate:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
starforge-plugin-sdk = { path = "crates/starforge-plugin-sdk" }

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

```rust
use starforge_plugin_sdk::{export_plugin, Plugin, PluginRegistrar};

struct MyPlugin;

impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "my-plugin" }
    fn version(&self) -> &'static str { "0.1.0" }
    fn description(&self) -> &'static str { "My StarForge plugin" }
    fn execute(&self, args: &[String]) -> Result<(), String> {
        println!("Hello from my-plugin! args={:?}", args);
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn register(registrar: &mut dyn PluginRegistrar) {
    registrar.register_plugin(Box::new(MyPlugin));
}

export_plugin!(register);
```

Build with the **same** Rust toolchain used to build StarForge:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

---

## Security considerations

- Never load plugins from sources you do not control.
- Prefer `--path` installs from artifacts you have reviewed.
- The `--force` flag bypasses the source trust warning but does **not**
  bypass the ABI/version compatibility checks — those run unconditionally.
- There is no code-signing verification beyond source classification.
  Use OS-level file integrity tools (e.g., `sha256sum`) if you need
  cryptographic assurance.
