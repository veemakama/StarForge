## Philosophy

Security and auditability are critical in blockchain tooling where users interact with real assets and sensitive keys. Every security-relevant operation should:

1. **Be logged** - Operations that affect security state must be recorded
2. **Be traceable** - Include enough context to understand what happened
3. **Be sanitized** - Remove sensitive data from logs
4. **Be useful** - Provide actionable information for debugging and auditing

StarForge uses **structured logging** (JSON format available) with the `tracing` crate to ensure logs are machine-parseable and can be aggregated for analysis.

---

## Sensitivity Levels

### Public Information
Safe to log in all contexts:
- User-provided wallet/contract names
- Public keys (Stellar G-accounts)
- Network names (testnet, mainnet)
- Operation types (create, deploy, inspect)
- Success/failure status
- Timestamps

Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "operation": "wallet_create",
  "wallet_name": "alice",
  "network": "testnet",
  "encrypted": true,
  "success": true
}
```

### Private Information
Log only at DEBUG/TRACE level or never:
- Account addresses in some contexts
- Gas costs and fees (operational)
- Algorithm parameters (KDF iterations, salt size)
- Error messages with technical details

Example (only at DEBUG level):
```rust
debug!(address = %redact_public_key(addr, Level::DEBUG), "Account balance query");
```

### Sensitive Information
**NEVER log under any circumstances:**
- Private keys / secret keys
- Passphrases
- Encryption keys or derived keys
- Signed transactions or XDR payloads
- Wallet backup data
- Plugin source code or binaries
- Authentication tokens

---

## What to Log

### For Every Security-Relevant Operation

1. **Operation Type** - What is being done (create, encrypt, deploy, load, execute)
2. **Operation Status** - Success or failure
3. **Operation Context** - Who/what triggered it, which account/resource
4. **Timestamp** - When it happened
5. **Duration** - How long it took (important for crypto operations)
6. **Error Details** - If failed, what went wrong (without revealing secrets)

Example structure:
```rust
info!(
    operation = "wallet_encrypt",
    wallet = "alice",
    status = "success",
    duration_ms = 245,
    "Wallet encryption completed"
);
```

### Specific Operation Categories

#### Wallet Operations
```

Logs:
  - wallet name, network, requested amount, balance after, success
  
Operation: wallet_remove
Logs:
  - wallet name, network, confirmation status, success
  
Operation: wallet_show

  - wallet name, reveal_requested, balance_query_status
```

#### Plugin Operations

Operation: plugin_load
Logs:
  - plugin name, plugin version, source path, compatibility check result
  
Operation: plugin_execute
Logs:
  - plugin name, command args (sanitized), execution status, duration
  
Operation: plugin_unload
Logs:
  - plugin name, cleanup status, success
```

#### Deployment Operations
```
Operation: contract_deploy
Logs:
  - contract path, network, account, wasm hash, deployment status, gas
  
Operation: contract_validate
Logs:
  - contract path, validation status, file size, warnings/errors
  
Operation: contract_inspect
Logs:
  - contract address, network, inspection status, metadata retrieved
```

#### Network Operations
```
Operation: network_switch
Logs:
  - from_network, to_network, connectivity_check_status
  
Operation: network_test
Logs:
  - network name, horizon_status, soroban_status, latency
```

---

## What NOT to Log

### Absolutely Never Log

```rust
// ❌ WRONG - Never log secret keys
warn!("Secret key: {}", secret_key);

// ❌ WRONG - Never log passphrases
info!("User entered passphrase: {}", passphrase);

// ❌ WRONG - Never log private/sensitive material
debug!("Encryption key: {}", derived_key);

// ❌ WRONG - Never log full XDR payloads
trace!("Signed transaction: {}", xdr_envelope);
```

### Avoid Logging

```rust
// ❌ Unnecessary - Don't log function entry/exit for every function
trace!("Entering validate_key()");

// ❌ Noisy - Don't log every iteration
for item in items {
    trace!("Processing: {:?}", item);  // Too verbose
}

// ❌ Sensitive context - Don't log full error messages with context
error!("Failed to decrypt wallet {} with passphrase {}: {}", name, pass, err);
```

### Safe to Log (with Redaction)

```rust
// ✅ Redact public keys at INFO level
info!(key = %redact_public_key(addr, Level::INFO), "Account queried");

// ✅ Never redact error messages (no secrets)
error!("Network connection failed: {}", err);

// ✅ Log operation metadata
info!(
    wallet = "alice",
    network = "testnet",
    operation = "fund",
    status = "success"
);
```

## Structured Logging Format

StarForge uses structured logging for machine-parseability. Each log entry includes:

### Human-Readable Format
```
2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z [INFO] starforge::commands::wallet: Wallet encrypted
    wallet: alice
    algorithm: aes-256-gcm
    iterations: 100000
    duration_ms: 245
```

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "target": "starforge::commands::wallet",
  "message": "Wallet encrypted",
  "fields": {
    "wallet": "alice",
    "algorithm": "aes-256-gcm",
    "iterations": 100000,
    "duration_ms": 245
  }
}
```

### Key Guidelines

1. **Use structured fields** - Not free-text messages
2. **Use consistent names** - `wallet`, `network`, `operation`, `status`
3. **Use appropriate types** - Timestamps as ISO-8601, durations as milliseconds
4. **Be specific** - `status: "success"` not `message: "OK"`

## Audit Trail Requirements

### Timestamp Precision

All security operations must include precise timestamps for audit correlation:

```rust
use chrono::Utc;

info!(
    timestamp = %Utc::now(),
    operation = "wallet_create",
    "New wallet created"
);
```

### Contextual Information

Each security operation should include enough context to understand the full flow:

```rust
info!(
    session_id = uuid,
    user_action = "import_wallet",
    wallet_name = "alice",
    network = "testnet",
    encrypted = true,
    duration_ms = 150,
    status = "success",
    "Wallet import completed"
);
```

### Error Details Without Secrets

When logging errors, include diagnostic information but not sensitive data:

```rust
// ✅ Good - Specific error type without secrets
error!(
    wallet = "alice",
    error_type = "DecryptionFailed",
    error_code = "ERR_WRONG_PASSPHRASE",
    attempts = 3,
    "Failed to decrypt wallet"
);

// ❌ Bad - Too specific about secrets
error!(
    wallet = "alice",
    error = "Failed to decrypt with provided passphrase",
    passphrase_length = 8,
    "Decryption failed"
);
```

### Result Summaries

Always log the result of security operations:

```rust
info!(
    operation = "deploy",
    account = redact_public_key(addr, Level::INFO),
    network = "testnet",
    wasm_hash = hash,
    gas_used = 12345,
    result = "success",
    "Contract deployed"
);
```

## Code Examples

### Logging a Wallet Creation

```rust
use tracing::info;

fn create_wallet(name: &str, network: &str, encrypt: bool) -> Result<Wallet> {
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    
    let wallet = Wallet::new(name, network)?;
    
    if encrypt {
        wallet.encrypt(passphrase)?;
    }
    
    let duration_ms = start.elapsed().as_millis() as u64;
    
    info!(
        wallet = name,
        network = network,
        encrypted = encrypt,
        duration_ms = duration_ms,
        status = "success",
        "Wallet created"
    );
    
    Ok(wallet)
}
```

### Logging a Plugin Load

```rust
use tracing::info;

fn load_plugin(plugin_path: &str, name: &str) -> Result<Plugin> {
    let plugin = unsafe { pm.load_plugin(plugin_path)? };
    
    let plugin_version = plugin.version();
    let starforge_version = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");
    
    info!(
        plugin_name = name,
        plugin_version = plugin_version,
        starforge_version = starforge_version,
        source = plugin_path,
        status = "success",
        "Plugin loaded"
    );
    
    Ok(plugin)
}
```

### Logging a Contract Deployment

```rust
use tracing::info;

fn deploy_contract(wasm_path: &str, network: &str, account: &str) -> Result<String> {
    let wasm_hash = calculate_wasm_hash(wasm_path)?;
    
    let result = execute_deployment(wasm_path, network, account)?;
    
    info!(
        wasm_hash = %wasm_hash,
        network = network,
        account = %redact_public_key(account, Level::INFO),
        contract_address = %result.address,
        gas_used = result.gas_used,
        status = "success",
        "Contract deployed"
    );
    
    Ok(result.address)
}
```

### Logging with Error Handling

```rust
use tracing::{info, error};

fn fund_wallet(wallet: &str, network: &str, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    match request_funds(wallet, network, amount) {
        Ok(tx_hash) => {
            info!(
                wallet = wallet,
                network = network,
                amount = amount,
                transaction_hash = tx_hash,
                status = "success",
                "Wallet funded"
            );
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(e) => {
            error!(
                wallet = wallet,
                network = network,
                error_type = "FundingFailed",
                error_message = %e,
                status = "failed",
                "Failed to fund wallet"
            );
            Err(e)
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Verification and Testing

### Testing Security Logging

Always test that security operations log correctly:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_wallet_creation_is_logged() {
    // Setup logging capture
    let subscriber = tracing_subscriber::fmt()
        .with_max_level(Level::INFO)
        .finish();
    
    let _guard = tracing::subscriber::set_default(subscriber);
    
    // Perform security operation
    let wallet = Wallet::new("test", "testnet").unwrap();
    
    // Verify logs were emitted (integration test would check log output)
    assert_eq!(wallet.name, "test");
}
```

### Checking Logs in CI

Enable JSON logging in CI for better parsing:

```bash
# In CI environment
cargo test --log-format json --log-dir ./logs

# Verify logs contain required fields
jq '.fields | has("wallet") and has("status")' logs/*.log | grep true
```

### Log Audit Review

Regular review of security logs:

1. **Weekly** - Check for failed authentication attempts
2. **On deployment** - Verify deployment logs are complete
3. **On incidents** - Full log trace of affected operations
4. **On access** - Who accessed sensitive operations and when
